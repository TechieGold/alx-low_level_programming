	The C preprocessor will process directives that are inserted into the C source code. The directives allows additional actions to be taken on the C source code before it is compiled into object code.
	Preprocessing directivess are lines in your program that start with #. The # is followed by an identifier that is that is the directive name. for example, the #define is the directive that define a macro.

	for the purpose of this concept, I will be solving the following tasks;

task 0 - Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

task 1 - Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

task 2 - Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line
	You are allowed to use the standard library

task 3 - Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

task 4 - Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
